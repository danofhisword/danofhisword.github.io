<p>I’ve been doing a bunch of BDD acceptance tests and automation lately, having some wins and losses and learning new stuff as I go. 
Whilst enjoying working with Cucumber, I had a bit of challenge with sharing and issolation.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I like the solution I arrived at, I need to use it in anger more to see that for myself. 
It’s a bit complex and I still don’t like the global-ness of the world stuff, could be evolved somewhat. 
I hope it at least gives some ideas to others or helps someone come up with something more elegant!</p>

<p><b>The problem …</b></p>

<p>I was writing a bunch of scenarios for Features and wanted to re-use Steps and related code across various Features.</p>

<p>I was hoping to make it quicker to compose new Scenarios, quicker to modify and maintain by drying up my code a bit.
Cucumber and Groovy can be a bit challenging, the way step files are compiled and the scope of variables between them seemed to cause me the challenges.</p>

<p>I also desired to encapsulate some state and operations so they are not shared, to avoid wierd global state side-effects impacting Scenarios.</p>

<p>My general desire was:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A JUnit runnable which ran my Features based on a Annotation (e.g. @AcceptanceTest).</li>
    <li>Many features, multiple Feature files (one per Feature), multiple Scenarios within the Feature.</li>
	<li>A dedicated Step file for a Feature, which also contains state for the Features Scenarios.</li>
	<li>A shared Step file and class for the bits I wanted to re-use across Features.</li>
	<li>Independence of tests, state not carried over between scenarios.</li>
	<li>Not too complex/abstract to understand (not sure I got there). Clear hierarchy, not spaghetti.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/CucumberSharing.gif" height="300px" /></p>

<p>Some of the pains I seemed to encounter:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can't see variables defined in one step file in another step file</li>
	<li>You can't see variables in global scope (or world scope) within any classes within step files</li>
	<li>Can't have steps with the same "phrase" in multiple feature files, they clash at runtime</li>
	<li>Even using glue to try and separate steps with separate JUnit runnable tests, it seems Cucumber will still by convention find your other steps and they clash</li>
	<li>Mix-ins seem useful, but seem to get themselves in a pickle when running in cucumber, things getting defined in scope you wouldn't expect and lazy re-initialising when you don't expect</li>
	<li>World can only be defined once, you can't redefine it or add to it easily</li>
	<li>I even got in a weird state where the one Step file was being compiled (I think) twice, saying Steps were duplicates of themselves... that was fun.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Where I’m at so far … </b></p>

<p>I used a combination of World() and Feature specific “State” classes in Step files.</p>

<p>I defined the World once, but I use @Before hooks to refresh the World properties in place.</p>

<p>Note, I also pass the world reference in (delegate) when I create the step state, so I can use properties from the world internally or delegate to it.
This was kind of the discovery for me that led to the pattern I have now for better or worse.</p>

<p>Here’s an example shared steps file:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">World</span><span class="o">(){</span>
    <span class="c1">// By delegating World to SharedWorld, we can see it in other step files</span>
    <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">SharedWorld</span><span class="o">()</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
 
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">SharedWorld</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">MySharedProperty</span> <span class="n">sharedProperty</span>
    <span class="c1">// Some shared functions I want to call elsewhere</span>
    <span class="n">def</span> <span class="nf">mySharedMethod</span><span class="o">(){</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
 
<span class="n">Given</span><span class="o">(~</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">did</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="n">shared</span> <span class="n">stuff</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">checks$</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span>
    <span class="c1">// Cool, I can see this stuff, it&#39;s in World scope, I&#39;ll use it</span>
    <span class="n">mySharedMethod</span><span class="o">()</span>    
    <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">sharedProperty</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="kc">null</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>And here is an example feature steps:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">MyFeatureTestState</span> <span class="n">featureTestState</span>
 
<span class="nf">Before</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="nd">@MyFeature</span><span class="err">&#39;</span><span class="o">){</span>
    <span class="c1">// Re-initialise the state before the test</span>

<p>And a feature:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nd">@MyFeature</span>
<span class="nl">Feature:</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">feature</span>

<p><b>UPDATE</b></p>

<p>Someone also mentioned to me the use of the Groovy <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/gapi/groovy/transform/Field.html">@Field</a> annotation on your global fields, so you could see them in other step files.</p>

<p>Probably something to use at your discretion w.r.t global state.</p>

<p>I need to play with it some more, could be a much simpler solution than what I have above for sharing!</p>

<p>In shared script:</p>

<p>@Field
SomeObject myObject</p>

<p>In other Groovy scripts:</p>

<p>myObject.doSomething()</p>
